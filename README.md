# Quantifying Land Fragmentation: an Entropy-Based Approach

*Abstract*

Landscapes fragmented by transportation infrastructure and built-up areas are characterized by small, isolated fragments of natural habitat, and such idea of disorder in the land patches is here linked to the concept of entropy. This work aims to quantify land fragmentation through the estimation of spatial mutual information and spatial residual entropy, which allows decomposition of entropy into a term accounting for the role of space and a second term quantifying the residual heterogeneity. Results are easily interpretable and can be used both as absolute measures of land fragmentation as well as for a comparison over space and time. This method has proven useful in synthesizing land fragmentation with a single, interpretable number, but it does not allow to make inference on the phenomenon. For this reason, in the second part of this work, a two-level geostatistical binary probit model is employed to obtain a Bayesian estimate of the probability components of entropy and a consequent Bayesian estimator of entropy. Results show that the entropy of the underlying spatial process can be estimated in a proper way by the aforementioned model, and the resulting entropy surfaces have proved to be useful to satisfactorily visualize the phenomenon of land fragmentation.
